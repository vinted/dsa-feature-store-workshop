# Feature Store Workshop

## What can you expect?

You will learn the most important concepts of the Feast feature store. You will learn something new about Python/Jupyter/Bash or all of these. You'll have fun!

## What will happen?

The workshop will be about the concepts of the feature store, but we will not be using the real feature store or real data. We won't have a presentation. We'll be coding in real-time with comments from Dovydas.

The final notebook will be available after the workshop.

Martynas will provide some actual "real-world" comments about how the Trust Intelligence Team has used the feature store in real-life. Moreover, Martynas will be available to help you with issues in case you have any.

## What you need to do?

[ACTION] I'd like you to pair up with a person that you don't know. If you are very well connected and know everyone, just join a person that you haven't worked with before/recently. The goal of this is not to chat during the workshop but to help each other in case you are stuck or don't understand something. And of course discuss what you've learned in the the workshop after it is over.

[ACTION] At the end of the session please fill in the feedback form here: https://forms.gle/ci6DNLd29CjM5bX27
